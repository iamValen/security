The transaction is sent to every computer (or node) in a decentralized network to be verified

The verified transaction is added to a new block of data containing other recently verified transactions

If any blocks are altered, its hash and all following hashes in the chain are automatically recalculated. The altered chain will no longer match the chains stored by the rest of the network, and will be rejected.
