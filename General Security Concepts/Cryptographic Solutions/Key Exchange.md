#### A logistical challenge
- How do you share an encryption key across an insecure medium without physically transferring the key?
#### Out-of-band key exchange
- Don't send the symmetric key over the 'net
- Telephone, courier, in-person, etc.
#### In-band key exchange
- It's on the network
- Protect the key with additional encryption
- Use asymmetric encryption to deliver a symmetric key
