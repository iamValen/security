## Combination of principles
- The fundamentals of security
- Sometimes referenced as the AIC Triad

# Confidentiality

#### Certain information should only be known to certain people
- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems
#### Encryption
- Encode messages so only certain people can read it
#### Access controls
- Selectively restrict access to a resource

# Integrity
- Messages can't be modified without detection
#### Data is stored and transferred as intened
- Any modification to the data would be identified
#### Hashing
- Map data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length
#### Digital signatures
- Mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data
#### Certificates
- Combine with a digital signature to verify an individual
#### Non-repudiation
- Provides proof of integrity
# Availability
- Systems and networks must be up and running
#### Information is accessible to authorized users
- Always at your fingertips
#### Redundancy
- Build services that will always be available
#### Fault tolerance
- System will continue to run even when a failure occurs
#### Patching
- Stability
- Close security holes
