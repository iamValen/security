## Choosing the framework
#### Work towards a known baseline

- Evaluate existing security policies


## Compare and contrast
#### Theccomparison
- Evaluate existing systems
#### Identify weaknesses
- Along with the most effective processes
#### A detailed analysis

- Break those into smaller segments


## The analysis and report
#### The final comparison
- Detailed baseline objectives
- A clear view of the current state

#### Need a path to get from the current security to thegoal
- This will almost certainly include time, money, and lots of change control

#### Time to create the gap analysis report
- A formal description of the current state
- Recommendations for meeting the baseline
