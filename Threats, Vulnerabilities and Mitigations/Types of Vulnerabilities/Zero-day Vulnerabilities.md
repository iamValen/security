#### Many applications have vulnerabilities
- We've just not found them yet
#### Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability
- The good guys share these with developers
#### Attackers keep these yet-to-be-discovered holes to themselves
- They want to use these for their personal gain


## Zero-day attacks
#### Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities
- They create exploits against these vulnerabilities
#### The vendor has no idea the vulnerability exists
- They don't have a fix for an unknown problem
#### Zero-day attacks
- An attack without a patch or method of mitigation
- A race to exploit the vulnerability or create a patch
- Difficult to defend against the unknown
