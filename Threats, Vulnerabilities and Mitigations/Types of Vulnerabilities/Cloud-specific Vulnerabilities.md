## Security in the cloud
#### Cloud adoption has been nearly universal
- It's difficult to find a company NOT using the cloud
#### We've put sensitive data in the cloud
- The attackers would like this data
#### We're not putting in the right protections
- 76% of organizations aren't using MFA for management console users
#### Simple best-practices aren't being used
- 63% of code in production is unpatched
- Vulnerabilities rated high or critical (CVSS >= 7.0)


## Attack the service
#### Denial of Service (DoS)
- A fundamental attack type
#### Authentication bypass
- Take advantage of weak or faulty authentication
#### Directory traversal
- Faulty configurations put data at risk
#### Remote code execution
- Take advantage of unpatched systems


## Attack the application
#### Web application attacks have increased
- Log4j and Spring Cloud Function
- Easy to exploit, rewards are extensive
#### Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Take advantage of poor input validation
#### Out of bounds write
- Write to unauthorized memory areas
- Data corruption, crashing, or code execution
#### SQL injection
- Get direct access to a database
