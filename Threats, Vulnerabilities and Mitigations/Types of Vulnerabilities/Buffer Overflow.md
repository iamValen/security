#### Overwriting a buffer of memory
- Spills over into other memory areas
#### Developers need to perform bounds checking
- The attacker spend a lot of time looking for openings
#### Not a simple exploit
- Takes time to avoid crashing things
- Takes time to make it do what you want
#### A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable
- Which means that a system can be compromised
