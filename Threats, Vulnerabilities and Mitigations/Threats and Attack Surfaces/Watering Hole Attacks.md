#### What if your network was really secure?
- You didn't even plug in that USB key from the parking lot
#### The attackers can't get in
- Not responding to phishing emails
- Not opening any email attachments
#### Have the mountain come to you
- Go where the mountain hangs out
- The watering hole
- That requires a bit of research


## Executing the watering hole
#### Determine which website the victim group uses
- Educated guess - local coffee or sandwich shop
- Industry-related sites
#### Infect one of these third-party sites
- Site vulnerability
- Email attachments
#### Infect all visitors
- But you're just looking for specific victims
- Now you're in


## Because that's where the money is
#### January 2017
#### Polish Financial Supervision Authority, National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico, State-owned bank in Uruguay
- The watering hole was sufficiently poisoned
#### Visiting the site would download malicious JavaScript files
- But only to IP addresses matching banks and other financial institutions
#### We don't know if the attack worked


## Watching the watering hole
#### Defense-in-depth
- Layered defense
- It's never one thing
#### Firewalls and IPS

#### Anti-virus / Anti-malware signature updates
- The Polish Financial Supervision Authority attack code was recognized and stopped by generic signatures in Symantec's anti-virus software
